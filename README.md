## Introduction

# Team Bunker Sierra – WRO Future Engineers 2025

We are a team from Baja California, México, composed of two members: Diego Alejandro Salas Díaz and Jacobo Arteaga Castañeda from Bunker Robotics. Both team members have experience in other competitions, specifically the Robomission category, totaling 8 years of combined experience.

This is our first year in the Future Engineers category. We began our preparation at the start of the year (January 2025), and over time, our robot has gone through several iterations. In fact, our current robot looks significantly different from the version used in the regional stage.

In this document, we will detail our robot's components, their functions, and how they work together. We will also explain some of the key changes we have made to the robot, supported by visual evidence.

Please note: All requested supplementary information will be available in its corresponding folder within the repository.

**Robot Specifications:**

- Weight (Maximum Load): 1165 grams.
